# The Hellenistic Age A Very Short Introduction
- ‘As a child, be well-behaved; as a young man, self-controlled; in middle age, just; in old age, a good counsellor; in dying, without grief.’
- Ancient Greek history is today conventionally divided into four periods: Archaic (from around 800 to 500 bc), Classical (500 to 323 bc), Hellenistic (323 to 30 bc) and Roman Imperial (30 bc to—say—ad 284).
- In the first generation after Alexander’s death (323–281 bc), this empire fractured into three successor kingdoms, each ruled by a Macedonian king: the Antigonids in Macedon, the Ptolemies in Egypt, and the Seleucids in western and central Asia.
- In Asia, a minor Macedonian officer called Seleucus, appointed as satrap of Babylon in 320 bc, gradually built up a formidable realm in Mesopotamia, Iran, and the East; by 301 bc, he had established his rule over the entire eastern half of the old Persian empire.
- By the middle years of the 3rd century bc, the new balance of power was firmly established. The bulk of Alexander’s empire was divided into three Macedonian successor-states: the Antigonid kingdom in Macedon, the Ptolemaic kingdom of Egypt, and the vast Seleucid realm in western and central Asia.
- The political planning of Plato’s Republic and Aristotle’s Politics had no Hellenistic sequels. Instead, the Epicureans and Stoics (and other Hellenistic schools of thought, the Cynics and Sceptics) understood the task of philosophy to be the therapeutic treatment of the individual soul.
